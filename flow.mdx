## Fetching products

Using the [`/products`](/get-all-products) endpoint, you can fetch a list of all available products and their prices.

Currently, we offer the following products:

- Residential
- Premium Residential
- ISP

---

## Creating a sub-user

All proxy purchases must be attached to a sub-user. When creating one, you must provide the following information:

- name
- username (minimum 10 characters)
- password (minimum 10 characters)
- email

The username and password will be used as the proxy credentials

---

## Purchasing a plan

When you create a sub-user, you will be given a `sub_user_id`. This ID is used to purchase a plan.

To purchase a plan, you need to pass the following information:

- Type (`RESIDENTIAL`, `PREMIUM_RESIDENTIAL`, `PRIVATE_ISP`)
- Quantity (1, 10, 100, etc)

If you purchase a `PRIVATE_ISP` plan, you will also need to provide the following information:

- Duration (`MONTHLY`, `QUATERLY`, `SEMI-ANNUALLY`, `ANNUALLY`)
- Region (`DE`, `UK`, `US`, `AU`)

## Using your proxies

### Residential & Premium Residential

Build your proxy URL by using the following format:

`78.46.251.50:40111:<USERNAME>-package-resi:<PASSWORD>`

`78.46.251.50:40111:<USERNAME>-package-premium:<PASSWORD>`

If you want to use specific countries, states, cities, you can use the `Location` endpoints to get the correct values.

#### Example

`78.46.251.50:40111:<USERNAME>-package-premium-country-US:<PASSWORD>`

`78.46.251.50:40111:<USERNAME>-package-premium-country-US-state-california-city-san_francisco:<PASSWORD>`

---

### ISP

ISP plans are a bit different, you will need to [**fetch the sub-user**](/sub-user/retrieve-a-specific-sub-user) to and parse the `proxyList` field which is an array of all their proxies.
